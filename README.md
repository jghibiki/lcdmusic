lcdmusic
========
A project to make use of a box I recieved from work with a Matrix Orbital and an array of card readers + usb on the front. The point of this project is to create a menu set, with help from lcdproc, to be able to navigate through audio files stored on the box, using the lcd screen to manage, and play the music. Additionally it will be used to automount any media insertet into one of the auxilary ports and proveide the option to play the music on the media or copy it to the internal memory, where upon the music would become part of the "library" of music stored on the box.
